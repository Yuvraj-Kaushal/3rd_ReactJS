# 3rd_ReactJS

My third ReactJS repo. It's a simple animation done with the help of lottie animation with controlled functions (Start , Restart , Pause , Resume). 

View it here - https://Yuvraj-kaushal.github.io/3rd_ReactJS/

You can also use lottie animation by executing the command below in your terminal :- 

Command - npm install react-lottie

Then import the lottie and .json from the command below :- 

Command - import Lottie from "react-lottie";

Command - import animationData from "./data.json"; (Here, 'data.json' is the json file downloaded from the lottie website. Don't get confused) 

You can read the documentation of lottie for better understanding.
